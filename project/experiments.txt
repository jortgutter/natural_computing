BaseCNN:
x # epochs (test with early stopping? Is a callback, later used for setting args.n_epochs)
x Change # layers
x Different # channels (default is powers of 2)
- Extra decision layer? (for non-linear combinations of features (no softmax activation for first))
x Different activation functions for conv layers (relu, leaky relu, tanh)
x Different dropout probabilities (max 0.5)

Store # parameters, training-time and accuracies carefully

Ensemble:
- Error correlation
- Test 3 classes as dropout
- Graph of ensemble size vs accuracy
- Graph of ensemble networks size (# layers/channels) vs accuracy
